## My process

I began with styling individual components and setting up my typography before moving onto the layout. I used a mixture of flexbox and grid for this, using flexbox for more individual elements such as the stars or lists while I used grid for the main layout or where I saw fit.

I utilized transforms to adjust the cards as shown in the design file. This maintained the layout that I built while still moving the elements in a non-disruptive way.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
